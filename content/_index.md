I live in London, where I work with hedge funds and try to convince as many people as possible to read Matt Levine's Money Stuff. 

Last spring I graduated from the University of Chicago, where I studied Economics, Statistics, and Computer Science. In the past I've worked for the Boston Red Sox working on baseball statistics and for the Data Liberation Project helping to democratize access to crucial government datasets.

I have a Substack, where I write about technology, politics, and society, sometimes all at once.
