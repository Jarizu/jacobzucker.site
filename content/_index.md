I live in London, where I work with hedge funds and try to convince as many people as possible to read Matt Levine's Money Stuff. Last spring I graduated from the University of Chicago, where I studied Economics, Statistics, and Computer Science. I have a Substack, where I write about technology, politics, and society, sometimes all at once.
