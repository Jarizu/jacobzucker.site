# Projects

A collection of things I've built.

## AccentGuessr

I made a GeoGuessr-like that asks you to guess where people are from based solely on hearing them read out a standardized passage in English. Many thanks to the GMU Speech Accent Archive for creating such a repository.

## IWDGuessr

I set up a game that has you guess which among two Magic cards has the higher "improvement when drawn" from a given draft metagame. This is an imperfect proxy for card quality but I thought it could help some people drill a given format. Website coming soon

## Stylint

Personalizable style guide for small newspapers. Website also coming soon
