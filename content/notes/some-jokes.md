There's lots of discourse around Jews these days. We have Jeffrey Epstein to thank for that. One strange consequence of the recent release of his emails is that [more people than ever](https://trends.google.com/explore?q=goyim&date=today%201-y&geo=Worldwide) are using the term "goyim." It's a curious pseudo-slur, and it reminds me of some of my favorite Jew jokes. Below I have left a chronicle of a few of the good ones I've encountered in my 22 years of life as a Jew. 

**Soviet emigration**

For many decades, the Soviet Union limited emigration. Many Jews in particular wanted to leave the country, as they were treated quite poorly there, but leaving was prohibited. International pressure forced their hand, and they finally started allowing some Jews to leave their country. This man wanted to go to New York, but the agent at the gate to the airport was giving him a hard time.

"Why are you leaving our communist paradise? Is it that you can't make enough money here?" 

No, I make a decent living as a doctor here. I can't complain. 

"Is it because of our state atheism? Do you want to flaunt your religion?" 

No, no, I'm not a very religious person. I can't complain. 

"What is it? Is it the women, do you think the women in New York will be more beautiful?" 

That's not it, I can't complain about Russian women. 

"What then? Why are you leaving for New York?" 

In New York, I can complain. 

**The country club**

Three businessmen, all born Jewish but now Christian, are meeting for lunch at a very nice country club.

Daniel is the host. He's a member at the club. He shares with his friends: "Thank God I decided to convert to Christianity. If I hadn't started going to church, they never would have let me become a member at a place like this." 

His companion Jonathan nods sagely and says: "Me, I would have been happy to go to synagogue every week. But religion matters a lot to my wife's family, so I converted." 

The third businessman, named Ezra, chimes in: "Myself, I converted for the superiority of the teachings." 

The other two men turn to him shocked. Daniel asks: "What are you, a fucking goy?"

**Trump and Reform Jews**

What's the difference between Donald Trump and a Reform Jew? 

Trump has Jewish grandchildren.

**Beggars in the Vatican**

Two beggars set up shop outside the Sistine Chapel. They both have their hats in front of them, but while one's hat is overflowing with coins and even euro bills the other is struggling to attract more than a few pence.

The successful beggar has a cardboard sign in front of him with a cross and the words "Jesus saves" written in sharpie. The unsuccessful beggar also has a cardboard sign, but this one has the Star of David scrawled in sharpie, and a few words in the Hebrew script.

A Catholic priest walks by and notices these two beggars. He stops in front of the Jewish beggar and stoops down.

"Of course, I don't have anything against you or your religion, sir. But given where you are," he gestures around him. "You might find a bit more success if you were to put away that sign."

The Jewish beggar turns to the Christian beggar and says, "Can you believe that? This goy is trying to show *us* how to make money!"

**Funny you should say that**

A middle-aged Jewish man goes to his rabbi: "Rabbi, you gotta help me. My son, for 30 years he's a Jew, and now bam! He says he's a Christian!"

"Funny you should say that," the Rabbi replies. "I'm having the same problem with my kid."

So they go see Rabbi Rabinowitz. "Both of our sons say they're Christians now."

"Funny you should say that," the elder Rabbi says. "My son, too!"

They go to Rabbi Spiegel, the eldest of all. Same story. Finally they all pray to Adonai: "Oh, mighty God, our sons have been good Jews for 30 years, but now they're saying they're Christians!"

A voice booms from the heavens: "Funny you should say that..."

**Gentile businessmen**

Two gentile businessmen run into each other on the Upper East Side. 

The first man asks the second: "How's the business going?" 

The second man responds: "It's going great!"
