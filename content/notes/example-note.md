I figured I might as well have a website. Unlike [my Substack](https://jacobzucker.substack.com), I plan to use this space for more miscellaneous thoughts that don't fit neatly into a longform, rigorously researched piece. Although perhaps some of my doodles here will make it into Substack pieces eventually, in one form or another.
