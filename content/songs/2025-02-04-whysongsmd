I get a lot of enjoyment out of music. Often the music I listen to isn't especially well-known, with a limited digital footprint. There's so much great music out there without any commentary about it. 

Now, am I the greatest person for the task? Probably not. I am by no means an expert on music criticism. I don't really think that I even have a good instinct for this sort of thing necessarily. But I am interested in cultivating that instinct. In my Substack, I found that the practice of actually sitting down and writing things led to dramatically higher-quailty output over time. Holding myself to a higher standard by actually iterating publicly leads to better improvement as well.

I don't expect to hold this stuff to quite the same standard, given the ambitions for consistency and my relative lack of expertise. But I feel strongly about music, and I think it would be a fun project. So if I can contribute to the collective corpus in my own way then I might as well do so.
