**Artist:** Weatherday \
**Song:** Come In \
**Album:** Come In (2019) 

*Come in*!

*I'm still here \
I'm almost floored \
Poorly drawn \
Hope you're bored \
Sinking feeling \
Weather day \
I'll be here \
Hope you stay \
So come in*

*I never thought I'd hear those words coming from you*

Above you'll find all the lyrics of Come In, a 96-second noise pop/emo track from anonymous Swedish artist Weatherday. It's a really excellent one, managing to jam a lot of emotion into a lyrically concise package. 

It starts off with some knocking at a door, followed by that cutesy sample-sounding line. That's immediately followed by headbanging-type instrumentals, setting the very noisy tone for the rest of the song. The verse's vocals manage to effectively convey the angst of the whole process, as the singer copes with the absence of the one they love. 

It's the first song on the album, and works successfully as an invite to the artist's emotional world. It's a chaotic and deeply frustrated one, but I'm a sucker for that sort of thing.
